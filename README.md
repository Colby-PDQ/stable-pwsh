# stable-pwsh
Stable releases of Powershell scripts from an **amateur**. They should work, but they are also always being updated and modified.

All code found here is designed to be used in a closed (and often **testing**) environment. These scripts are also designed for use in a helpdesk environment, so redundant and simplified functions are frequent.

Additional work will likely be needed for security and stability in your environments.
